This is a basic code to track data with Linkit One and send them over gprs to Ubidots. It's based on this code with some modifications: https://github.com/chipmc/AirQualitySensorProject

Just replace the XXX with your token from Ubidots and the variable names with yours from Ubidots. And the APN settings from your mobile network have to be replaced as well. Then you should be up and running.

I am using a Grove RGB-Light Sensor to measure the colors.
